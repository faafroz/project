Project Description

Title - My App

Summary

My App is a web-based application designed to demonstrate user authentication, content management, and interaction between a Single Page Application (SPA) and a RESTful API. The application enables users to create, edit, delete, and view posts, with additional features like a joke service integration. The app was built using the following tech stack:

Frontend: Angular (SPA)

Backend: Express.js (RESTful API)

Database: MongoDB (connected via Mongoose ODM)

Key Functionalities:

User authentication (login, logout, and signup)
JWT token handling with local storage integration
Routing with guards to restrict access to protected pages
Create, update, and delete posts
Spinner implementation for better user experience
Handling CORS errors using interceptors

The SPA communicates with the RESTful API through HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Angular handles routing, dynamic rendering of components, and form interactions, while the Express server processes the requests and persists data in MongoDB.

Design Specifications

Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture:

Frontend:

Angular components and services are organized for features like authentication, post management, and navigation.

Routing is implemented to navigate between different pages (e.g., login, new post, edit post).

AuthGuards.ts is used to secure routes by verifying JWT tokens.

Backend:

The Express server has dedicated controllers for authentication, posts, and other API endpoints.

Middleware handles CORS issues, token validation, and error handling.

Database:

MongoDB stores user and post data, with Mongoose providing schema-based data modeling.

Look and Feel

Header:

A navigation bar with links for "Jokes," "New Post," and "Logout."

Dynamic display based on user authentication status.

Footer:

Displays copyright information.

Content Pages:

Responsive layout with a purple theme.

Form validation ensures required fields like "Title" and "Content" are filled.

Spinner for loading states.

Future Work

As a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), My App is functional but can be enhanced with additional features and refinements. Future improvements include:

Feature Enhancements:

Implementing two-way data binding for forms to improve usability.

Adding advanced authentication features such as password recovery and multi-factor authentication.

Enabling user profile management with avatar uploads.

Performance Optimizations:

Caching API responses for faster loading times.

Optimizing database queries for better performance under high load.

Scalability:

Implementing a cloud-based database like MongoDB Atlas.

Adding support for multiple environments (development, staging, production).

User Interface Improvements:

Adding animations and transitions for better user experience.

Making the app mobile-friendly with responsive design improvements.

Additional Tools:

Testing: Integrating Jest for unit tests and Cypress for end-to-end testing.

Monitoring: Adding tools like Postman for API testing and tools like Prometheus/Grafana for server monitoring.

Deployment: Automating CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.

Conclusion

My App showcases how an SPA and a RESTful API can work together to provide a seamless user experience. While the current MVP is functional, the suggested future improvements can further enhance the appâ€™s utility, scalability, and user engagement.
